# times-table-list
An interactive web page for children to practise their times tables.

Different times tables can be selected by clicking the buttons at the top of the page. Using the drag and drop API the user has to match up the correct answers to the questions. Answers can be checked by clicking on the ‘Check Answer’ button which turns the correct answers green and the wrong answers red. For a challenge, the ‘Random Order’ button can be clicked. This puts the questions in a random order.
